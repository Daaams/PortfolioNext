                            I aim to make the every day life of people around me easier.
                            I would like to be able to have informations,  knowledges that I am looking for at my fingertips. Don't you ? The knowledge transmission with simplicity and in a few clicks is one of my priorities.
                            I am a student in the 2nd year of BUT Informatique at the University of Bordeaux, Gradignan site. I had the opportunity to develop computer skills.
                            I am interested in the development of web and mobile applications on the backend side.
